# Git

- Git repository (or repo)
  - Workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder (it does so by tracking a directory and all nested subdirectories)
  - Anytime we want to use Git with a project, we need to create a new git repository
  - We can have as many repos on our machine as needed (all with separate histories and contents)
- The `.git` directory
  - Located in all git repositories you initialize
  - 
- 

## Basic commands

### `git init`

- Creates a new git repository
- We must initialize a repo before we can do anything git-related
- Initialization is done once per project, in the top-level folder containing it

### `git status`

- Gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents
