# Operating Systems

- _Why do we need an Operating System?_ :arrow_right: we don't really need it, but it makes things a lot easier to deal with
- It's easier to deal with hardware resources using an abstraction such as an Operating System
- Operating Systems do the heavy lifting for us :arrow_right: let alone think of all different hardware types, their drivers and vendors we would have to adjust our way of working with for
- Operating Systems can help facilitate cross-compatability between different hardware and, or softwares

## Operating System (OS) semantics

- Operating System is a software that manages (access to [hardware]) resources
- Applications "talk" to the Operating System, which then deals with the resources for them
- Most Operating Systems are general purpose :arrow_right: 
- Operating Systems deal with process scheduling
  - Scheduling is critical
  - Fair share of resources to all processes
  - Processes "fight" over access to CPU/Memory/IO
- Operating System APIs abstract away the hardware
  - E.g., POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a (limited) way to abstract the hardware
  - Idea: "your" application works on any hardware
  - Reality: occasional breaking changes
