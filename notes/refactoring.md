# Refactoring

- Start with a clear goal
  - Define the specific improvement you want to make
  - Focus on one aspect of the code at a time
- Use incremental refactoring
  - Make small, manageable changes ("baby steps" refactoring)
  - Don't overhaul everything at once
- Create unit tests before refactoring
  - Ensure existing functionality is covered by tests
  - Use tests to verify that refactoring doesn't break anything
- Apply the "rule of three"
  - When you encounter similar code for the third time, consider refactoring it into a reusable component
- Follow SOLID principles
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open-Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
- Use design patterns
  - Implement appropriate design patterns to solve common problems
  - Understand when and how to apply different patterns
- Improve code readability
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Break down long functions into smaller, focused ones
  - Remove duplicate code
- Optimize performance (when necessary)
  - Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
  - Refactor performance-critical sections
- Seek peer review
  - Have colleagues review your refactored code
  - Be open to feedback and alternative approaches
- Document your refactoring process
  - Keep notes on the changes you make
  - Explain the reasoning behind significant refactors
- Embrace continuous improvement
  - Remember that perfect code doesn't exist
  - Focus on making meaningful improvements over time
  - Balance refactoring with delivering new features
