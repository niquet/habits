# Debugging

- Set clear goals
  - Define the specific issue you're trying to solve
  - Prioritize problems and tackle them one at a time
- Leverage debugging tools
  - Use tools available in your development environment
  - Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific points
  - Step through code line by line
  - Inspect variables to understand their state and flow
- Time-box your efforts
  - Set a specific time limit for each debugging session
  - Move on or seek help if you're stuck beyond the time limit
- Document your process
  - Keep notes on the issues you encounter
  - Record the solutions you implement
  - Document your reasoning behind decisions
- Implement logging and error handling
  - Use logging to track the flow of your application
  - Implement proper error handling to catch and identify issues
- Use rubber duck debugging
  - Explain your code and the problem to an inanimate object (or a colleague)
  - Often, verbalizing the issue leads to discovering the solution
- Create reproducible test cases
  - Develop minimal examples that demonstrate the bug
  - Use these for testing and to communicate issues to others
- Seek peer review
  - Collaborate with colleagues on difficult bugs
  - Participate in code reviews to catch issues early
- Learn from each B=bug
  - Analyze root causes of bugs you find
  - Use insights to improve your coding practices
- Embrace a growth mindset
  - View debugging as an opportunity to learn
  - Stay patient and persistent when facing challenging issues
