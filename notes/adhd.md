# ADHD

- Managing ADHD as a software engineer; approaches below
- **Embrace the MVP (Minumum Viable Product) mindset**
  - Start with a basic version that solves the core problem
  - Iterate and improve based on feedback
  - _Remember:_ Done is better than perfect
- **Practice rapid prototyping**
  - Build quick, rough prototypes to test ideas
  - Focus on functionality over polish in the early stages
  - Use this approach to validate concepts before deep analysis
- **Set clear, achievable goals**
  - Break large projects into smaller, manageable tasks
  - Use the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
  - Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency
- **Practice time-boxed decision-making/time-boxing techniques**
  - Set a deadline for making decisions and analysis
  - Gather essential information, then commit to a choice, _or_
  - Use techniques like the Pomodoro method (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break)
  - Move forward with the best solution you have when the time is up
  - _Remember:_ that most decisions are reversible if needed
- **Adopt a "bias for action" mindset**
  - _Remember:_ Taking action often provides more insights than endless analysis
  - Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities
  - Celebrate small wins to build momentum
- **Use the "5-second rule"**
  - When you have an idea, take action within 5 seconds
  - This helps overcome the initial resistance to starting
- **Implement a personal kanban board**
  - Visualize your workflow
  - Limit work in progress to focus on completion
  - Move tasks from "To Do" to "Doing" to "Done"
- **Seek feedback early and often**
  - Share your work with colleagues or mentors
  - Use their input to guide your next steps
  - This reduces the pressure of making perfect decisions in isolation
- **Reflect and adjust regularly**
  - Schedule weekly reviews of your progress
  - Identify what's working and what's not
  - Adjust your approach based on these insights
