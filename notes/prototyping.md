## Prototyping

- Understand the requirements
  - Determine the problem you are trying to solve
  - Identify the core functionalities that need to be implemented
  - Gather requirements from stakeholders and users
  - Define the scope of the prototype to focus on critical components
  - Define the evaluation metrics
- **Quick design**
  - Choose a simple architecture or algorithm to start with
  - Sketch out the architecture of the system, including databases, APIs, and services
  - Decide on the technology stack
  - Create a simple schema for your database and basic API endpoints
- Build the prototype
  - Implement the basic database schema and a few API endpoints
  - Ensure that the prototype can handle basic CRUD operations (or the basic functionality necessary)
  - Integrate any necessary third-party services (e.g., authentication, payment gateways)
- Gather feedback
  - Deploy the prototype to a staging environment
  - Share the prototype with stakeholders and end-users for feedback
  - Demonstrate functionality and evaluate based on the defined evaluation metrics
- **Iterate and improve**
  - Refine the database schema and API endpoints based on feedback
  - Add more features incrementally, ensuring each addition is tested
  - Optimize the performance and scalability of the prototype
- Finalize and document
  - Once the prototype meets the requirements, document the architecture and API specifications
  - Prepare for a more robust implementation, considering security, scalability, and maintainability
  - Integrate with the existing system (if necessary)
- **Tips for success**
  - _Keep it simple:_ focus on the core functionalities and avoid over-engineering
  - _Time-boxing_: set strict deadlines for each iteration to avoid endless revisions
  - _Reuse components:_ leverage existing libraries, frameworks, and tools to speed up development
  - _Collaborate:_ engage with stakeholders and team members regularly to align on goals and gather diverse perspectives
