# (High) Agency

- Agency: ability to make decisions, take action, influence your own life
- Involves taking control of your life, refusing to play the victim, making decisions that align with your values, even when it's hard

## High agency in action
- **Embrace autonomy**
  - Practice making decisions without seeking approval from others (independent decisions)
  - Learn to say no when something doesn't align with your goals or values (establish boundaries, prioritize yourself)
- **Take action**
  - Start small, begin with tasks that contribute to your larger goals
  - *Embrace imperfection*; start now and adjust along the way (itâ€™s easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary one)
- **Be more resilient**
  - Engage in activities that can help you stay present (mindfulness)
  - Manage stress and learn about yourself
  - *Reframe failures*; instead of setbacks, see them as learning opportunities
- **Find positive relationships**
  - Spend time with positive people who inspire and support you
  - Regularly show appreciation to the people in your life
