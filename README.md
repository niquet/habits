## Software Engineering Bits - about this collection

A collection of software engineering learnings from various resources, such as those listed in the [charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) repo.

## Principles

The goal of this page is to collect and centralize the best bits from the various resources. This page is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather my personal guide. I try to keep it light and avoid excessive detail.

The selection of resources summarized is opinionated. The structure of this repo is based on the order within the amazing repo by charlax.

## Topics

### Code reviews

- To ask good questions, do the following:
  - Describe what's happening in sufficient detail that we can follow along
  - Provide the necessary background for us to understand what's going on, even if we aren't experts in your particular area
  - Tell us why you need to know the answer: What led you here? Is it idle curiosity or is this somehow blocking you on a project? We don't need your whole life story, just give us some context here.
  - Share your research on your problem; what have you found so far? Why didn't it work? And if you didn't do any research â€¦ should you even be asking? If you're inviting us to spend our valuable time helping you, it's only fair that you put in a reasonable amount of your valuable time into crafting a decent question. Help us help you!
