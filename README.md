## Software Engineering Bits - about this collection

A collection of software engineering learnings from various resources, such as those listed in the [charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) repo.

## Principles

The goal of this page is to collect and centralize the best bits from the various resources. This page is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather my personal guide. I try to keep it light and avoid excessive detail.

The selection of resources summarized is opinionated. The structure of this repo is based on the order within the amazing repo by charlax.
