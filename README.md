## Software Engineering Bits - about this collection

A collection of software engineering learnings from various resources, such as those listed in the [charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) repo.

## Principles

The goal of this page is to collect and centralize the best bits from the various resources. This page is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather my personal guide. I try to keep it light and avoid excessive detail.

The selection of resources summarized is opinionated. The structure of this repo is based on the order within the amazing repo by charlax.

### Coding & code quality

Practice coding
- **Code regurlarly**
- Code often, learn a language in-depth, and keep solving real-world problems
- Biggest contributor to your progress is how much you practice
- You must apply your knowledge by writing a lot of code
- Coding daily is a great habit to pick up
- Aim to work on meaningful tasks and problems every day which you solve with code
- If you're not coding daily, for whatever reason, try to find ways to — pick up extra projects at work, move to a team which does a lot of coding, work on a side project that sharpens your programming skillset
- You need to code daily to keep growing into a competent software engineer
- **Ask for code reviews**
- Code should work, be read and understood by others, and follow common conventions
- After you write code, get feedback on it, so you can improve it
- Aim to get feedback on all the code you write, even if code reviews aren't required
- Ask more epxerienced people for extra feedback to help you grow faster
- If getting additional code reviews is hard, ask a colleague to pair woth you, so you can walk them through the code and ask which areas of improvement they see
- If there's nobody to work with, try finding someone from outside your team who's experienced with the technology or domain, and can give meaningful feedback
- (Learn from code reviews) Make notes on the feedback you get and if you see repeated comments, consider addressing them
- (Deal with harsh code reviews) Assume the comment is directed at the code, not you (Do not take it personally)
- **Read as much code as you write**
- Get involved early in code reviews across the team or the codebase (even when you're not an expert in the language, or very familiar with the code base)
- Make it a habit to go through each change colleagues make, understand what it does, and make notes on the approaches taken
- When something is unclear, ask the author
- Even better, read code written outsde of your team or company
- If you can access other projects in your workplace, start following code changes and code reviews by teams whose codebases you depend on
- Teams and companies often follow conventions specific to their environment
- Read open-source code to see other people's code and get a sense of what's going on beyond your company
- Try to find an actively developed open-source project which works with a similar language as you use
- Check out a project on GitHub, familiarize yourself with how it works, and then start following the changes
- Try to make sense of that's happening, which type of code is being written, and the feedback which code reviewers give
- **Code some more**
- Build a small side project that solves a minor problem for you, your friends, or your family
- Write code that works and try picking up new approaches or technology stacks
- Complete a tutorial or training with coding exercises
- Do coding challenges like those on LeetCode, Project Euler, or others, and practice a language which you use, and improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills
- Do regular code katas as they help to familiarize with a language and improve your problem-solving and algorithmic skills
- Search for daily code kata challenges and aim to do them daily, for a few weeks, until the katas stop being challenging

Readable code
- Unreadable code is a major contributor to technical debt; tech debt is a major contributor to teams slowing down
- If code is not readable, engineers spend a lot of time on figuring out what id does and how it works, and might even misunderstand the code and its behavior
- Readable, well-tested code makes refactoring, extending, and modifying a codebase as eas as possible
- Readable, well-tested code is the foundation of a solid codebase that gives engineers confidence to make changes
- "Readable code" begins with code you find easy to read
- When finishing coding, take a break and clear your mind, then re-read the code assuming no knowledge of it – can you follow the code? Do the names of variables and methids help you understand what they do? Are the comments in places where the code isn't enough? Is the style of the code consistent across the changes?
- Think about how you could make the code more readable
- Test of readable code: _can others understand it?_
- Get feedback via code reviews and ask how clear the code is
- Readable code will attract few to no clarifying questions – each question and misunderstanding is a hint that the code could be more readable
- If you're happy with how clear the code is and other developers find it readable, you're on the right track
- **Things to pay attention to**
- Always write code with two main goals in mind: (1) The code should be correct, meaning it produces the expected results when executed and (2) Other developers find it easy to read and understand
- A few things to pay attention to :point_down:
- Naming - Use self-explanatory, concise names. Stick to consistent naming approaches in line with the naming used on the codebase.
- Well-structured - The codebase is easy to navigate as functions, classes, and modules follow a logical structure. Formatting is consistent across classes and the codebase.
- Keep the code simple (KISS) - The simpler code is, the easier it is to read and understand. With this in mind, aim for small functions and classes that don't grow too big. Avoid introducing complex coding solutions for the sake of it, when you could get things done simpler.
- Single responsibility - Aim for functions to do just one thing, and for classes to have a main responsibility. A single focus makes it easer to test for correctness, and also for tests to be reusable.
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY) - Avoid copy-pasting code. Instead, if you find the need to reuse, consider refactoring the code so it follows the single responsibility principle.
- Comments - Explain the "why" on the code, not the "how" in your comments.
- Continuously refactor to maintain readability - Readable codebases stay readable as they grow thanks to continuous refactoring.
